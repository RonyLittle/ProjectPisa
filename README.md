## Introduction

Dear All, thank you for visiting my project! Since GitHub does not allow us to upload our `.ipynb` file with executed code fragments and dynamic visualizations due to file size limitations, to fully immerse yourself in the project, you need to download the following files from the directory: `Project.ipynb`, `first_half.csv`, `second_half.csv`, and place them in a single local directory on your machine. 

## Requirements

Next, to ensure smooth execution, you need to install Python version 3.11.9 or higher and install the libraries used in our project via the command line:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn statsmodels tensorflow matplotlib seaborn plotly squarify sas7bdat pyreadstat pycountry ipython
```
## Running the Project

Then, you can run the .ipynb file using a method convenient for you. For example, we did it through the terminal:

Navigate to the directory containing the files:

```sh
cd <directory_path>
```

Start Jupyter Lab with the project file:

```sh
jupyter lab Project.ipynb
```

## Conclusion

After following these instructions, you can fully immerse yourself in our project and explore our "Deep Analysis of PISA 2022 Data".

Enjoy your study! Thank you for your attention.
